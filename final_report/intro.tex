\chapter{Introduction}

This report summaries the comprehensive design, implementation and overall team collaboration that was required to meet the objectives of module 7CCSMGPR â€“ Software Development Group Project. The objective of this project was to develop a distributed chat system, with two separate clients developed in two separate domains, for example, desktop and mobile domains, with the clients being able to search for other people on the server and initiate a chat with them. The chat opens up a connection between the two users that by passes the server. A further requirement entailed that there are three components: a server which can tell users how to contact other people; client A which users can use; and client B which users can also use.

The report firstly highlights a review of related works (Chapter \ref{ch:review}) before describing the functional requirements and design envisioned and showcasing the software design of the client and server in UML and detailed Use Cases (Chapter \ref{ch:r-d}).

Furthermore this report details the exhaustive steps taken during the implementation phase of the project (Chapter \ref{ch:impl}), highlighting the major implementation decisions taken, as well as the testing activities embarked upon.

In conclusion, a critical evaluation of the team work (Chapter \ref{ch:team}) and the obtained result (Chapter \ref{ch:eval}) is presented.
